                <img src="images/chess-960-1.png" id="chess960image" alt="Example of a random Chess 960 setup." />
                <p>
                    Chess 960, or Fischer Chess, has a very simple setup if you
                    have technology, which you should have because you are on
                    this site. For the setup, you can use a computer to generate
                    a setup by using this
                    <a href="https://www.chessgames.com/perl/fischerandom"
                        >960 Chess Generator</a
                    >, or find another way to randomize the setup manually. If
                    you will do it manually, after randomizing the back rank of
                    one side (the pawns stay the same), copy the setup on the
                    other side of the board. After you do that, play chess with
                    all the normal rules, whoever checkmates the opponent wins.

                    <p>
                        Although it seems like it shouldn't, castling is still
                        in the game. When you are castling, move the king
                        towards the rook until it is on the closer side of the
                        rook, and then move the rook to the other side of the
                        king. Keep in mind, the space between the king and the
                        rook has to be empty, and neither of the pieces could
                        have moved prior to castling, otherwise, you can't
                        castle. If the king and the rook are right next to each
                        other, just swap their positions.

                <h4>Strategy</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    Even though it looks simple, Chess 960 adds a whole new
                    layer of strategy. Forget about openings, in this variant,
                    you will have to adapt to every game you play. I recommend
                    developing all your pieces as soon as possible, and try to
                    control the middle. Keep you opponent's king position in
                    mind too, and try to prepare a deadly attack on your
                    opponent. It is hard to give direct advice because each game
                    is very different, so the best thing you can do is develop
                    you pieces and find major weaknesses in you opponents
                    defences.

                <h1>Mini Chess (6x6)</h1>
                <h4>Rules</h4>
                <img
                    src="images/mini6x6chessvariantssetup.png"
                    id="miniChessImage1"
                    alt="Image showing how the setup for Mini Chess looks."
                />
                <p>
                    Mini Chess is a variant of chess that makes the gameplay a
                    lot simpler and the game a lot shorter. The setup is shown
                    on the image to the right. On the first rank, it's rook,
                    bishop, queen, king, bishop, rook, and the second rank is
                    just pawns. Black has the same setup. Other than the setup,
                    all rules are the same, and castling works as normal; move
                    the king towards the rook until it is on the closer side of
                    the rook, and then move the rook to the other side of the
                    king.

                <h4>Strategy</h4>
                <img src="images/closed6x6game.png" id="miniChessImage2" alt="An example of a very closed Mini Chess game, with pieces having very restricted movement." />
                <p class="vright">
                    Mini Chess removes a lot of strategy because of the limited
                    movement options. Your main goal is to advance your pawns
                    while keeping a strong defense. If your opponent manages to
                    break through your pawn wall, they will gain a huge
                    advantage and it will be very difficult to defend. Avoid
                    moving pawns twice on their first move because doing so
                    makes them very vulnerable. Keep your rooks safe until the
                    endgame. Since your are on such a small, crowded board, they
                    lack flexibility early on but can dominate once the board
                    opens up. On the other hand, the bishops and queen are very
                    strong early game, just make sure to keep them in safe
                    locations, because it is easy to get trapped on this small
                    board (notice how on the image to the left, the pieces have
                    very low mobility here).

                <p>
                    Pre-Chess is a really strategic chess variant that adds a
                    whole new layer of planning. Before the game starts, all
                    pawns are placed in their normal positions, and then players
                    take turns setting up their side. Each player can have 2
                    bishops, 2 knights, 2 rooks, 1 queen, and a king. White
                    starts and puts any one piece on the rank closest to them.
                    Next, Black places 2 pieces or their rank, and each player
                    takes turns placing two pieces until all spaces on the 1st
                    and 8th ranks are full. Castling is still a rule, and if you
                    are confused, read the 960 chess castling rules, because
                    those principals are in every chess game when it comes to
                    castling. Keep in mind, everybody has to have exacltly 2
                    bishops, 2 knights, 2 rooks, 1 queen, and a king.

                    <p>
                        The Pre-Game extremely important in Pre-Chess because it
                        decides your playstyle and positioning. Whenever it is
                        your turn to place a piece, you want to place a piece
                        that is hard to counter, like the queen, or knight,
                        because they have very good mobility. Avoid placing your
                        king early on, because your opponent can start placing
                        their pieces in positions that put pressure on the king.
                        I recommend placing king on one side of the board, and
                        the rook on the complete opposite, so you can castle to
                        safety if there is lots of pressure. Make sure to avoid
                        having two bishops on same color squares. Your goal will
                        be to control as much space as possible, so make sure
                        you put your pieces in places that make them easily
                        developable. If you look at the image to the right, you
                        will see a good setup (white) vs bad setup (black).

                    <p>
                        Now it is time to put your planning to good use. In this
                        game, positioning is super important, so try to avoid
                        trading if you are in a better position. Don't trade an
                        active bishop for a trapped bishop, or a fully developed
                        knight for a knight on the rim. Try to pressure you
                        oppenents king side, and if they have a backup rook for
                        castling, make sure to either force the rook or king to
                        move, or have a mini attack on the rook's side. A major
                        part of this game is decided in the planning, so make
                        sure not to lose your positioning is you are winning,
                        and you'll be fine.
