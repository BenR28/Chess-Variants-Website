                <p>
                    Giveaway chess completely changes the rules of chess.
                    Instead of trying to checkmate the opponent, you have to
                    either lose all of your pieces or not be able to move a
                    piece on your turn. Now, this would be a pretty boring game
                    without extra rules, because players could chose to just not
                    to take any pieces. To counter this, a rule was added to
                    force players to take a piece when they can, and if you can
                    take multiple pieces, you can chose which onen to take. If
                    your king is taken, you keep playing, and you can even
                    promote a pawn to king!

                <h4>Strategy</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    Although Giveaway Chess completely changes the point of the
                    game, the strategy is way easier to understand. For your
                    first move, you need to make sure you make a move that
                    doesn't let your opponent immediately lose a piece. For
                    exmaple, e4 is a pretty bad first move because your opponent
                    can counter with f5 and you are already forced into a chain
                    of takes. In the early game, try to move your pawns only 1
                    space, and avoid moving knights into the center. Your main
                    priority is forcing your opponent into a position where they
                    have to continuosly tke your pieces. The pieces you should
                    try to get rid of are mainly queen and knights because they
                    have very good mobility. For the endgame, letting your
                    opponent promote a pawn isn't a bad idea, because they will
                    be forced to get a better piece, which gives you more
                    chances to blunder your own pieces.

                <h1>3+ (3 Check)</h1>
                <h4>Rules</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    3+ Chess has really simple rules. In addition to being able
                    to checkmate the opponent's king, you can also win by
                    putting them in check 3 times. Think of the king having 3
                    lives, and every time he is put in check, he loses one life.
                    Other than that, all the rules are exactly the same.
                </p>
                <h4>Strategy</h4>
                <p class="vright">
                    3+ Chess is one of my favorite variants because of the fast
                    paced and aggressive strategy that comes with it. The main
                    thing for you to keep in mind is that if you can check your
                    opponent safely, check them. You should also keep in mind
                    that your king also needs to stay safe, which is why
                    castling early is a very good strategy. One of the best
                    openings for this variant is the King's Fianchetto. The
                    reason for this is that your king is castled, your pawns are
                    in a good structure, and you develop a knight and bishop
                    that can defend your king and pressure the opponent. I would
                    definitely prioritize knights over bishops, because they
                    have the capabilities of checking the king easily,
                    especially in the endgame. Avoiding bishops is easy, because
                    they only have one color square to attack, and you can move
                    your king to safety easily.

                <h1>King of the Hill</h1>
                <h4>Rules</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    King of the Hill is another one of my favorite variants. The
                    only goal is to get your king to one of the middle 4 squares
                    or checkmate your opponent. Just to clear up any confusion,
                    the middle 4 squares are d4, d5, e4, e5.
                </p>
                <h4>Strategy</h4>
                <img src="images/koth-good-vs-bad.png" id="kothImage" alt="Chess King of the Hill position showing white in a better position than black. White focused on defending center, while black focused on pushing the king. This leaves the black king in a very vulnerable position." />
                <p class="vright">
                    The strategy on this variant varies based on you playstyle.
                    Your first objective is to get a strong defence on middle.
                    If you can't control middle, you can't really do anything.
                    Next, there's two strategies; push your pieces forward and
                    rush your king, or play agressive and try to checkmate the
                    king. I don't recommend pushing the king early, because it
                    gives the opponent the opportunity to checkmate you, and you
                    also spend your turns moving the king instead of defending
                    middle. The image on the left describes this well. Watch how
                    white developed all of their pieces, but black pushed the
                    king early. The king can barely move anywhere now, and is
                    very vulnerable. Try to avoid castling as it gets your king
                    out of the middle of the board. Instead, I recommend moving
                    your king up one space, still safe, but a little more out
                    there. This gets your king a little closer to middle, and
                    helps you develop your rooks. Developing all your pieces is
                    the most important part of this variant. Do not waste any
                    pieces.
