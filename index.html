                    Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, but
                    lots of people may start to think it's boring because of its
                    repetitive setup and rules. This is why people make
                    variants. Variants are a great way to add a mix to your
                    chess games. Whether you want the board to be randomly setup
                    each game, make your pieces explode, or add a duck to the
                    board, there are always different ways to play chess using
                    variants.
