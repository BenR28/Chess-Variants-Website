                I am a freshman in High School taking the Website Development
                class. This website was created as a final project for the
                class. I enjoy playing Chess in my free time, and think that
                more people should play Chess Variants. Chess variants are super
                underrated and can be really fun if you get a little bored of
                the base game, or just want to try something new.<br /><br />Contact:
