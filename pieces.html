                <h1>Duck Chess</h1>
                <h4>Rules</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    The rules to Duck chess are extremely simple. After white
                    makes their first move, they can place a duck piece to any
                    unnocupied location on the board. After that, after each
                    move, you move the duck to a different location anywhere on
                    the board. The duck cannot be taken, cannot take, but can be
                    jumped over.

                <p class="vright">
                    Duck chess adds quite a bit of strategy. You want to try to
                    use the duck to restrict piece movement. Mainly the king's
                    movement. You can also take a piece, and then block any
                    pieces from taking your piece, essentially winning you
                    material. You should also make sure your pieces are always
                    protected. Using pawns to protect is super effective, since
                    you can't use a duck to cut off protection. The image on the
                    right shows how white used the duck to stop black from
                    moving their e-pawn. Black did knight c6, and is about to
                    move the duck somewhere else.

                <h1>Seirawan</h1>
                <h4>Rules</h4>
                <img src="images/elephant-eagle.png" id="seirawanImage1" alt="An image showing how the elephant and the eagle pieces look." />
                <p>
                    Seirawan chess adds a nice little mix to the game by adding
                    two new pieces for each player. The setup is the same as a
                    normal chess game. Every time you move a piece for the first
                    time (not including the pawn), you may place a new piece in
                    its previous location. This means that you only have 8
                    chances to play the 2 new pieces. The 2 new pieces are the
                    elephant and the eagle. The elephant moves like a rook and a
                    knight combined, while the eagle moves like a knight and
                    bishop combined.
                </p>

                <p class="vright">
                    I recommend developing your 2 new pieces early. Make sure
                    that they are out in the open pretty early, and treat them
                    as 7-point pieces. I don't actually know how much they are
                    worth, but I'd say the elephant is around 7 and the eagle is
                    closer to 6. You can treat them as six or seven-point
                    pieces, but the important thing is to recognize that they’re
                    strong and you don’t want them sitting on the back rank
                    doing nothing. Getting them into active squares lets you
                    take advantage of their hybrid movement and pressure
                    multiple parts of the board at once. Just be careful not to
                    use them too much. Because they’re so powerful, your opponent
                    will happily trade weaker pieces to take them off the board
                    if you leave them hanging. Also, since both of them have a
                    little knight DNA, look for some sneaky forks that you can
                    apply. The image on the left shows black using their pieces
                    to their fullest potential, causing black to have many
                    winning tactics.

                <h1>Musketeer</h1>
                <h4>Rules</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    Musketeer Chess keeps the familiar 8×8 board and the usual
                    chess pieces, but before the game begins each player picks
                    from a set of ten special “musketeer” pieces. First, White
                    chooses one of the ten and places it on an invisible row
                    behind his back rank; then Black either accepts that choice
                    (in which case they choose a second piece) or declines — in
                    which case the default pair (Leopard + Cannon) is used. Once
                    both players have placed their two musketeer pieces behind
                    their back rank (on phantom ranks 0 and 9), the game
                    proceeds just like orthodox chess, with one big twist: a
                    musketeer piece only enters the board once the piece
                    directly in front of it moves for the first time (or is
                    removed before moving, in which case the musketeer is lost).
                    The musketeer pieces are shown in the image to the right.

                <h4>Strategy</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    This variant’s strategy becomes a lot more creative and
                    tactical than in regular chess. Because you don’t know
                    exactly when or where the extra pieces will appear,
                    memorizing standard openings loses much of its value. You
                    and your opponent must constantly adapt: choosing which
                    musketeer pieces to deploy, deciding where to “gate” them
                    (i.e. behind which original piece), and planning timing so
                    that their entry into play gives maximum impact while
                    minimizing risk. For instance, using powerful musketeer
                    pieces like Dragon or Chancellor can drastically shift
                    control — but deploying them carelessly might leave them
                    vulnerable or result in their loss if the front-rank piece
                    is captured before moving.
