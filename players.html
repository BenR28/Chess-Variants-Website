                <h4>Rules</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    4 Player Chess is very similar to regular chess, but the
                    board is bigger, and in a different shape. There is a
                    regular 8x8 board in the middle, but the edges include 3
                    extra files/ranks that extend out. Then use a regular chess
                    setup for each person. This is shown in the image to the
                    right. Pawns are still able to promote, they just have to
                    get to the complete opposite side of the board to do so. The
                    last person standing wins.
                </p>
                <h4>Strategy</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    The strategy for 4 Player Chess is very similar to regular
                    chess, there are just more pieces to look out for. Make sure
                    you pay attention to the opponents pieces, especially the
                    bishops and queens. You can also take advantage of opponents
                    pieces. If somebody has a big pressure on another player,
                    you can step in and apply more pressure, or even attack
                    their king because they have their pieces somewhere else.

                    <p>
                        In this chess variant, there are two regularly set up
                        chess boards, and two teams, each with two people. The
                        one person plays against another person from another
                        team, and then the other person from the first team
                        plays against the other person on the other team.
                        Basically Team 1 Player 1 vs T2P1, and T1P2 vs T2P2.
                        Keep in mind that the color the players play as have to
                        be the opposite of their teammate (ex. Player 1 = white,
                        Player 2 = black). You should also make sure you have a
                        little empty spot nearby for storing pieces.

                        For this variant, the rules are simple, but there is a
                        lot to keep in mind. Every time you take a piece, you
                        give it to your teammate and they "store" it somewhere.
                        That teammate, during their turn, instead of moving a
                        piece, can play one of their "stored" pieces. There are
                        restrictions that come with this power though. You are
                        not allowed to place a pawn on the 1st or 8th rank. You
                        also can't put a piece on top of an already existing
                        one. You are, however, allowed to place a piece to
                        check, or even checkmate the opponent.

                <h4>Strategy</h4>
                <p class="noImage">
                    The strategy for Bughouse is to coordinate with your
                    teammate. Some games let your talk as much as you want, but
                    others are on a time limit. Just keep in mind, if you need a
                    piece, secretly ask your teammate for one. Don't let the
                    other team know you need a queen, because then they'll avoid
                    queen trades. There are so many sneaky checkmates and
                    tactics you can perform with your "stored" pieces. A
                    majority of these tactics involve sneaky pins by placing a
                    bishop somewhere. Don't immediately play pieces when you get
                    them, but make sure you use them. Try to find a good time
                    and location to play each of your "stored" pieces.

                <h4>Rules</h4>
                <img src="images/boat.png" id="chaturajiImage1" alt="An image showing how the boat piece moves in Chaturaji. It moves just like a rook!" />
                <p>
                    The rules are simple in Chaturaji. The main confusion would
                    come from the new "boat" piece, but the "boat" just moves
                    like a rook. You are not allowed to castle, move pawns twice
                    on their first move, or en passant. Once a pawn reaches the
                    rank/file furthest away from its starting position, it can
                    promote to a boat, bishop, or knight. Pawns also move
                    forwards away from the king. This means that each person
                    will have pawns going in different directions, and it can
                    get confusing at times. Pawns still capture diagonally in
                    the direction they are moving.

                        The setup is shown in the image to the right. If you
                        can't see the image, here is a quick explanation.
                        Imagine each player has their own 2x4 grid of squares
                        where their pieces will go. This "box" goes from a1 to
                        d2. I will be giving all instructions relative to this
                        "box". The boat is in the bottom left. To the right of
                        the boat is the knight, and one more space to the right
                        is the bishop. The king goes in the bottom right corner
                        of your "box". Put one pawn above each of the four
                        pieces to fill up the box. Now rotate the entire board
                        90 degrees and repeat this process three more times so
                        that there are 4 people able to play the game.

                <p class="noImage">
                    The strategy in Chaturaji is basically the same as 4 Player
                    chess, just on a lesser scale. The kings are in vulnerable
                    positions, so marching your pawns forward is highly
                    recommended. I also really recommend saving your boat.
                    Endgames in Chaturaji are not very exciting without boats,
                    and it could get really hard to checkmate. Try to save all
                    of your pieces, as trading them with another player could
                    put you at a disadvantage.
